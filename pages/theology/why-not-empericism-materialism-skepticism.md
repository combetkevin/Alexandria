# Why Not Empericism, Materialism, or Skepticism

Empericism, materialism, and skepticism on rejecting anything immaterial.  But arguments, numbers, logic, etc which are necessary conditions of arguing, are immaterial.

# Why Not Empiricism

Empiricism is a theory that states that "knowledge comes only from sensory experience".  It can be summed up in Thomas Aquinas's Peripatetic axiom: "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses" adopted from the Peripatetic school of Greek philosophy, established by Aristotle.  In response to this David Hume, an empericist skeptic philosopher, basically says if an empericist states "knowledge comes only from sensory experience" and if they are consistant then they can not believe in immaterial transcendentals.  For example, when one sees ball A hit ball B they are not actually seeing "causation" but just 2 events.  Simply put, where in this sense data, under a rock, or in a microscope does one see "causation" itself?  One doesn't therefore none of these transcendentals can be proven emperically.  Thus, extended to the modern age if one is sufficiently skeptical then one can't justify the principles upon which science is based (logic, causality, the scientific method, etc.) because the principles are not emperical and thus can not be justified.  A system built on the Peripatetic axiom inherently collapses because it cannot justify it's claims.

## Immateriality of the Mind Argument

The immateriality of the mind is proven through an argument from the impossibility of the contrary.  A person inherently uses his mind to think through problems and make arguments.  This begs the question then: are thoughts immaterial or material?  An materialist would say that the mind is fundamentally material and thoughts are just an emergent property of cells in the brain.  In the materialist's worldview everything is just the interaction of matter/energy. This then begs further questions: what seperates the matter of the brain from the matter of the photons hitting the retina?  What seperates this from the photons being emitted from a light source or the electrons moving through the filament of that light source, and so on?  They are all equally important and necessary for the materialist's experience of the world.  And yet the materialist gives artificial ownership and importance to his arbitrary set of matter over the entire matter-energy dance of the universe.  If he were to take materialism to its logical conclusion then "he" doesn't actually exist because "he" is just an arbitrary set of material components in an ever-changing deterministic universe.  Any arguments "he" makes aren't actually "his".  In fact the act of argumentation is illusary because fundamentally everything is just matter in motion.  Thus if one were to follow through to the logical conclusions of materialism he would find it is inherently self-refuting.  The only other option then is that thoughts and, by extension other immaterial concepts like the self and others, are immaterial by necessity because we find the contrary to be false.

## The Eternality of Truth Argument

Leibniz demonstrates the eternality of truth by demonstrating the statement "Caesar crossed the Rubicon" is true even though it references an event that happened in history that we do not emperically experience.  No matter what happens in the future of this world or whatever flux happens in matter, nothing is going to change the truthfulness of that proposition.

## Numbers and Logic are not Material

Numbers: If you have seven coconuts and smash one you have not destroyed "sevenness".  Seven particulars is not equal to the universal invariant seven.

Logic: There are a whole host of mathematical concepts that mathematicians, engineers, and scientists will speak of as discovered and not invented like Mandlebrot sets.  Logic is not contingient on any material thing.

## Perennial problems for empiricism unanswered

- Myth of the Given
- Problem of the external world
- Induction 
- Status of immaterial objects 
- No properly basic beliefs
