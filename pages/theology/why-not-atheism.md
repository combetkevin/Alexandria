# Why Not Atheism?

## Transcendental Argument

- Strongest argument for God's existence because it shows the necessity of God's existence in a logical framework.
- Transcendental categories: things not known or proven through mere sense experience that are assumed for the possibility of knowledge at all (see Transcendental Argument topic)
- To deny any of these transcendentals you would negate the possibility of knowledge, cognition, reasoning, etc.
- Transcendentals are necessary for a worldview
- One can deny any of these and still have a worldview, but at that point they're being inconsistent & incoherent
- When we bundle all these necessary transcendentals together to justify one another, how do we justify this giant web?  The Divine Mind.
- The Divine Mind is the basis for these things and we can show this logically and show worldviews without this end up in relativism, contradiction, and self-refutation at a very fundamental level
- In short it shows that reasoning itself presupposes the Christian God.
- It's impossible to live your life as if "the good" is purely subjective
- Even such basic philosophical assumptions like whether there's an external world ultimately cannot be justified unless you have a world grounded in an external being like the Mind of God and not in our own subjective experience

## Naive Empiricism

- We utilize these abstract concepts like meaning, logic, math, love, beauty, aesthetics, telos, etc. are assumed but not empirically demonstrated
- We assume our senses match up to the external world.  Can we empirically verify that claim? No.
- Most atheists are naive empiricists: we only know what's true from sense experience.  We cannot prove that claim itself from sense experience so at a fundamental level it's contradictory.
- Beauty relates to form and symmetry
- Mathematics is discovered, not a human invention (i.e. Mandelbrot set) which shows mathematical concepts exist outside our mind

## Nihilism

- Nihilism is the end result of atheism
- Modern atheism since the enlightenment is just a flavor of revolutionary thought
- Epistemological self consciousnesses: over time becoming more consistent with your governing presuppositions
- Enlightenment/Scientific Revolution caused the rise of rationalism and universal enlightenment ideals which in a few centuries devolves into postmodernism and into will-to-power Nietzsche ideas into full Nihilism
- Even though "stage 1" atheism might not be nihilistic, if you're consistent the end result is nihilistic because there's not really any reason for anything
- Nihilism there's no reason to do X over Y and in effect all actions are perfectly equalized and it doesn't matter what happens... it just is
- Hume: you cant get an ought from an is, you cant get a standard/objective/value judgment from a mere is.  Just because something is the case doesn't lead to you ought to do this or believe that
- Atheism/materialism cannot provide any objective standard of ethics
- Well you have to be nice to people.  Why?  The natural world is full of predator/prey relations... why not harm people.  There's no reason for anything.  Events just are.
- Your own conciseness is just a series of chemical reactions and there's nothing that underlines them or gives them meaning... they just are

## Social Engineering

- Atheism is part of a larger social engineering tool and is promoted by very powerful & wealthy people not just because people want what's noble or true but actually to take society in a certain direction
- Studying the history of revolutionary movements you'll learn about worldviews and ideologies being weaponized (ie CIA using ideologies in Cold War era)
- Atheism & its worldviews have been used as psychological warfare tools
- Modern day atheists are being propped up by the system/establishment which is why they all tout the establishment line.  They all across the board wind up talking about the "normie" takes on everything.  (Tyson, Bill Nye, Micheal Shermer, etc).  Establishment pop mouthpieces.
- Atheist thinkers/writers are bing supported by the system to take us in a particular direction
