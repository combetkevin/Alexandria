# Transcendental Argument for God

**TODO: flesh this out**

The transcendental arguement for God (TAG) demonstrates there is only one unique condition that will satisfy all conditions for the possibility of knowledge, rationality, logic, and arguments.  This ultimate precondition is the Christian Triune God as He has revealed Himself to us.  The approach simply compares worldviews (claims on epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics) for coherence, explainatory power, and justificatory force.  We find the Christian worldview satisfies these conditions.  Furthermore, the claim is also proven from the impossibility of the contrary by showing all other worldviews (any view that denies the Christian view) are impossible and thus the Christian worldview is true.

Transcendant objects, or "transcendentals", are immaterial, invariant, universal, and interrelated concepts that must exist for the possibility of knowledge or predication.  Transcendental arguments involve the claim "X is a necessary condition for the possibility of Y: Y therefore X".  It is more fundamental than other types of claims like "X is Y" (lower order) or "All X are Y" (higher order) such that if one denies any transcendental claim then those less fundamental types of claims are not even possible.  For example, in order to make knowledge claims (lower order) one must have preconditions like the laws of logic, a self, spatio-temporal relationships, words having meaning, etc.  To deny any one of these preconditions would be to deny the possibility of knowledge, the ability to even make claims, and the possibility to experience objects.  This puts the denier in a self-refuting arguement or reductio ad absurdum.  Another example, in Aristotle's time the sophists tried to disprove the laws of logic.  However, in attempting to disprove the laws of logic they were using the laws of logic and thus their arguement was self refuting.  Immanuel Kant extended this idea by saying if you don't have these transcendental preconditions then you can't even have the possibility of knowledge of any objects in the first place.  Having knowledge of things presupposes a knower (the self), the ability to have knowledge (the mind), the concept of knowledge, and other transcendentals.

The way we prove God is more like the way we prove transcendentals.  This does not mean that God is identical to the transcendentals, but the way one proves Him is similar.  Only the Christian Trinitarian God gives a coherent, explainatory, and justificatory power to the basic assumptions of the things that make up a worldview: epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics.  Because these 3 concepts interlock they cannot explain or justify themselves on their own.  They have to be grounded in something that is even higher order.  Furthermore, the TAG arguement argues from the impossibility of the contrary and demonstrates that other worldviews at the paradigm-level are ultimately self-refuting.

The TAG 3-step process summarized:

1. **Knowledge**: claims about things
2. **Precondictions**: interlocking concepts that must exist for even the possibility of knowledge and experience
3. **Christian God**: grounds, justifies, makes coherent, and explains those interlocking preconditions

## Shredding evidential apologetics

**TODO: revisit this section**

Evidential apologetics argues God can be proven by using evidence that both the athiest and thiest share and that one need not presuppose God's existance.  It is based on classical foundationalism, the belief that there must be some infallibly certain starting point like logic, mathematics, etc.  This position inherently rejects circular arguments and is opposed to the coherence theory of justification.  

In this worldview one allows things that are not as certain to be the starting point for what should be more certain.  In other words, if God exists then God is more certain than the laws of logic and abstract principles one is appealing to because He is the ground of those things in the Christian paradigm.  How are you going to use things that He's the ground of as if they were more certain than Him and then say that God's existance is ~98% certain.  So mathematics is more certain than God's existance?  Then logic mathematics is more ultimate... 

Remember, there's never going to be any way to follow through the Peripatetic axiom and justify the things one believes in without appealing to the things one believe in.  Evidentialism therefore is circular and self-refutes the classical foundationalism it's built on.


Simply put, yes we use evidence but we don't put it ahead of the stronger, higher-order, more pressupositional arguments.

Also, evidential apologetics assumes access to an epistemically privilidged position which no one has.


## TAG does not prove anything and it's an assumption

What do you mean by prove?  Do you mean physical proof of immaterial preconditions?  That makes no sense because immaterial concepts can't be proven in a material way.  Not everything is demonstrated or proven in the same way.  For example, how one proves water boils at 100 degrees C is not the same as how one proves abstract math.  It's impossible to prove something abstract and immaterial by necessitating that it be proven in a material way.  Thus how one proves transcendentals and God is not the same as how one proves material objects.  The TAG proves things at the paradigm-level (epistemology, ethics, metaphysics) and provides coherence, explainatory power, and justificatory force.

## This is a circular arguement and circular arguments are invalid

At the paradigm-level all worldview arguments including the TAG are circular.  For example, how do you prove that words have meaning without using words?  How can you describe or define numbers without using numbers?  How can you argue for the status of logic without using logic?  This demonstrates at a certain level there's no lower or higher order thing that you can appeal to because they inherently become self-referencing.  Godel's Incompleteness Theorum shows it's impossible to avoid this circularity.  It is inherently self-refuting to demand a non-circular worldview at the paradigm-level.

## The TAG might show preconditions, but it does not prove God or any higher-order thing

**TODO: This needs more work**

Transcendentals are immaterial, invariant, universal, and interlocking concepts that must exist for the possibility of knowledge or predication.  By necessity they have to be somewhere or have some way of existance allowing them to be, irrespective of the ever-changing states of matter, time, space, and flux.  For example, Leibniz demonstrates the eternality of truth by saying "Caesar crossed the Rubicon", a statement that references an event that happened in history.  No matter what happens in the future of this world nothing is going to change the truthfulness of that proposition.  Thus one cannot locate transcendentals in matter.  Neither can one locate transcendentals in a finite human mind because the destruction of a human mind also does not change the truthfulness of the proposition.  Neither can these concepts "just exist" in a vacuum because there has to be a transcendental that provides the immaterial, invariant, universal, interlocking nature to transcendentals.  Thus by necessity there has to be a higher-order transcendental for these lower order transcendentals to exist.

This is why we need some type of omniscient, omnipresent mind to ground and interlock the transcendentals.  By necessity there must be some form of divine conceptualism that makes the transcendentals coherent, gives them explainatory power, and gives them justificatory force.  They are grounded in an invariant immaterial universal omniscient divine mind.

This is why the "omnis" of God are so important.

Note, the athiest might not agree with with this arguement.  Nevertheless it gives a coherent explainatory justification for transcendentals.  Remember we're comparing two paradigms: the athiest vs TAG.  Ours give a coherent explainatory justification for transcendentals.  The athiest paradigm cant even get off the ground and can't even explain how these transcendentals are even possible and negates the possibility of knowledge at all.
