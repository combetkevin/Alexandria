# Messianic Prophecies

The way the New Testamant treats prophecy is not simply by finding statements that refer to future events or a person to come but by by treating the entire Old Testamant as foreshadowing the life of Christ.  There are many types of Christs to come.

## Isaiah 53

```
1  Who has believed our report?
   And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
2  For He shall grow up before Him as a tender plant,
   And as a root out of dry ground.
   He has no form or comeliness;
   And when we see Him,
   There is no beauty that we should desire Him.
3  He is despised and rejected by men,
   A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.
   And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him;
   He was despised, and we did not esteem Him.

4  Surely He has borne our griefs
   And carried our sorrows;
   Yet we esteemed Him stricken,
   Smitten by God, and afflicted.
5  But He was wounded for our transgressions,
   He was bruised for our iniquities;
   The chastisement for our peace was upon Him,
   And by His stripes we are healed.
6  All we like sheep have gone astray;
   We have turned, every one, to his own way;
   And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all.

7  He was oppressed and He was afflicted,
   Yet He opened not His mouth;
   He was led as a lamb to the slaughter,
   And as a sheep before its shearers is silent,
   So He opened not His mouth.
8  He was taken from prison and from judgment,
   And who will declare His generation?
   For He was cut off from the land of the living;
   For the transgressions of My people He was stricken.
9  And they made His grave with the wicked—
   But with the rich at His death,
   Because He had done no violence,
   Nor was any deceit in His mouth.

10 Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him;
   He has put Him to grief.
   When You make His soul an offering for sin,
   He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days,
   And the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in His hand.
11 He shall see the labor of His soul, and be satisfied.
   By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many,
   For He shall bear their iniquities.
12 Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great,
   And He shall divide the spoil with the strong,
   Because He poured out His soul unto death,
   And He was numbered with the transgressors,
   And He bore the sin of many,
   And made intercession for the transgressors.

 - Isaiah 53 NKJV
```

Here Isaiah is making a prophecy that details the Servents suffering, bearing the sins of the world, dying a shameful death, being raised up, and exaulted to heaven.  Notice that [The Great Isaiah Scroll](http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/isaiah) is one of the original seven Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1947 AD and is dated around 125 BC.

Note in verse 10:

- an offering for sin: [asham](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/asham_817.htm) is the same word used in Leviticus for the guilt offering

## Isaiah 52:13-15

```
13 Behold, My Servant shall deal prudently;
   He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.
14 Just as many were astonished at you,
   So His visage was marred more than any man,
   And His form more than the sons of men;
15 So shall He sprinkle many nations.
   Kings shall shut their mouths at Him;
   For what had not been told them they shall see,
   And what they had not heard they shall consider.

- Isaiah 52:13-15 NKJV
```

Here Isaiah's prophacy shows the Servant is being exaulted to the Divine state of Yahweh.  If the servant was merely a creature, then this would be idolatry and blasphemy because no creature can share in God's unique and soverign enthronement over creation.  Note in verse 13 the Servant is:

- exalted: [varum](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/yarum_7311.htm) or "high"
- extolled: [venissa](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/venissa_5375.htm) or "lifted up"

## Isaiah 6:1-5

```
1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. 2 Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. 3 And one cried to another and said:

“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;
The whole earth is full of His glory!”

4 And the posts of the door were shaken by the voice of him who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.

5 So I said:

“Woe is me, for I am undone!
Because I am a man of unclean lips,
And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips;
For my eyes have seen the King,
The Lord of hosts.”

- Isaiah 6:1-5 NKJV
```

Here Isaiah has a vision where he beholds Yahweh in visible glory and visible form.  He describes Yahweh's enthronement over creation in the same language that he describes the Servant's exaultation.  Note in verse 1:

- Lord: [adonai](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/adonai_136.htm)
- high: [ram](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/ram_7311.htm)
- lifted up: [venissa](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/venissa_5375.htm)

## Isaiah 33:10

```
10 “Now I will rise,” says the Lord; “Now I will be exalted, Now I will lift Myself up.
- Isaiah 33:10 NKJV
```

Jesus rose from the dead, was exaultedm and lifted on high.  Note:

- Lord: [yahweh](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/yahweh_3068.htm)
- I will rise: [akum](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/akum_6965.htm)
- I will be exalted: [eromam](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/eromam_7311.htm)
- I will lift Myself up: [ennase](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/ennase_5375.htm)

## Isaiah 57:15

```
15 For thus says the High and Lofty One
   Who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:
   “I dwell in the high and holy place,
   With him who has a contrite and humble spirit,
   To revive the spirit of the humble,
   And to revive the heart of the contrite ones.
- Isaiah 57:15 NKJV
```

Notice ram (high) and nissa (lifted up) again.

## Psalms

David's psalms have the same pattern of the suffering servant found.

## Luke 24:44-46

```
44 Then He said to them, “These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.” 45 And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.

46 Then He said to them, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
- Luke 44:46 NKJV
```

## Romans 5:14

```
14 Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. 
- Romans 5:14 NKJV
```

Adam was a type of Christ to come.  Adam was made in the image of Christ and our Lord's coming wasn't a "plan B" but he was always pre-ordained to become incarnate.

## Matthew 12:39-40

```
39 But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
- Matthew 12:39-40 NKJV
```

Jesus said Jonah was a type of Christ to come.

## John 3:13

```
14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
- John 3:13 NKJV
```

Jesus said Moses lifting up the serpent was a type of Christ to come.

## Hebrews 7:3

```
1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2 to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all, first being translated “king of righteousness,” and then also king of Salem, meaning “king of peace,” 3 without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.
- Hebrews 7:3 NKJV
```

Melchizedek was made like Christ's office of priesthood and character.

## Genesis 37 & Matthew 1:16,19-20

In Genesis 37 God communicated to Joseph in dreams.  Joseph's father is Jacob.  Joseph has brothers who rejected him and handed him over to the Gentiles (specifically the Egyptians) and he is persecuted.  Then he is exaulted and becomes lord of the earth, the savior of the world, and second to pharoah.

In Matthew 1:16 Joseph has a father named Jacob who becomes the adoped father and legal guardian of Jesus.  New testemant Joseph recieves dreams and revelations from God as well, see Matthew 1:19-20.  Jesus was rejected by his bretheren and handed over to the Gentiles, was persecuted, exaulted to be the savior of the world, and became the lord of all creation second only to the Father in terms of authority.

## Genesis 3

The seed of the woman will crush the head of the serpent.  This is why there's a geneology in the Old Testamant from Adam & Eve all the way down to Jesus where Christ fills all 3 offices of prophet, priest, and king.  Jesus at the cross fufills the crushing of the head of the serpent.
