## Introduction to Syllogisms

### Terms

- **Syllogism**: `P1 P2 -> C` The formal structure of a logical argument where two premises (major and minor) lead to a conclusion.
- **Premise**: A proposition that is used as evidence in an argument.
- **Conclusion**: Asserted by the logical result of an argument based on the relationship of the stated premises.
- **Thesis**: The final conclusion and ultimate point proven by the premises.
- **Valid Argument**: An argument that contains no logical fallacies.
- **Sound Argument**: An argument that is valid and whose premises are true, therefore it is necessary that the conclusion is true.

- **Conversion**: Switch S and P to get an equivalent meaning

### Syllogism

Major premise: All M are P.
Minor premise: All S are M.
Conclusion: All S are P.

- `M`: Middle term
- `S`: Subject of the conclusion
- `P`: Predicate of the conclusion
- Major: Links M with P
- Minor: Links M with S

### Types of Propositions

The premises and conclusions of a syllogism can be any 4 types:

| code | quantifier | subject | copula  | predicate | type                   |
|:-----|:-----------|:--------|:-------:|:---------:|:-----------------------|
| `A`  | All        | S       | are     | P         | universal affirmative  |
| `E`  | No         | S       | are     | P         | universal negative     |
| `I`  | Some       | S       | are     | P         | particular affirmative |
| `O`  | Some       | S       | are not | P         | particular negative    |

- Example A: All dogs are animals
- Example E: No dogs are houses
- Example I: Some dogs are German Shepherds
- Example O: Some dogs are not Beagles

### Syllogistic Figures

A **figure** in logic is the classification of syllogisms according to the arrangement of the middle term.

|          | Fig1 | Fig2 | Fig3 | Fig4 |
|:---------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**Major** | M-P  | P-M  | M-P  | P-M  |
|**Minor** | S-M  | S-M  | M-S  | M-S  |
|**Conc.** | S-P  | S-P  | S-P  | S-P  |
|          | AAA  | EAE  | AII  | AEE  |
|          | EAE  | AEE  | IAI  | IAI  |
|          | AII  | EIO  | EIO  | EIO  |
|          | EIO  | AOO  | OAO  | AEO  |
|          | AAI  | EAO  | EAO  | EAO  |
|          | EAO  | AEO  | AAI  | AAI  |

### Modern Square of Opposition

```
A --- E
| \ / |
|  X  |
| / \ |
I --- O
```

- `A <-> O`: Contradiction
- `E <-> I`: Contradiction
- `A <-> E`: Undetermined
- `E <-> O`: Undetermined
- `O <-> I`: Undetermined
- `I <-> A`: Undetermined
- Example: If you know proposition A to be true, then you know proposition O to be false.
- Example: If you know proposition A to be true, then you do not know whether proposition E is true or false.

Forms:

- **AAA**: e.g. All dogs are animals.  All animals are living beings.  Therefore, all dogs are living beings.


- Universals is the set that contains all members of that set

## Argument

```
A All physical things are particulars (E.G. This pen is a particular pen.  It does not represent the class of all markers.  It's one marker.)
E No universals are particulars
E No universals are physical things
Conversion: No physical things are universals

E No physical things are universals
I Some concepts are universals
O Some concepts are not physical things

O Some concepts are not physical things
A All concepts are in the mind
O Some (things) in the mind are not physical things
Translated: Some things in the mind are not physical

O Some things in the mind are not physical
A All things in the mind are part of the mind
O Some part of the mind is not physical
Translated to I** Some part of the mind is immaterial

**Contradiction** 
- **I** Some part of the mind is not physical
- **E** No part of the mind is immaterial (materialism thesis)
```
