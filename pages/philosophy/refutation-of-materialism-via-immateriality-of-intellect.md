## Introduction to Syllogisms

Terms:

- **Syllogism**: The formal structure of a logical argument.  A set of two premises that lead to a conclusion (P1 P2 -> C).
- **Deductive Argument**: If the premises are true then it is necessary that the conclusion must be true (impossible that the conclusion is false)
- **Sounds Argument**: A valid argument in which the premises of the argument are true
- **Subject(S)**:
- **Predicate(P)**:
- **Conversion**: Switch S and P to get an equivalent meaning

List of Propositional Forms:

- **A = All S are P**: A universal positive proposition(e.g. All dogs are animals)
- **E = No S are P**: A universal negative proposition(e.g. No dogs are houses)
- **I = Some S are P**: A proposition that contains a particular positive (e.g. Some dogs are German Shepherds)
- **O = Some S are not P**: A proposition that contains a particular negative (e.g. Some dogs are not Beagles)

List of Valid Syllogistic Forms:

| Fig.1 | Fig.2 | Fig.3 | Fig.4 |
|:-----:|:------|:------|:------|
|  AAA  |  EAE  |  IAI  |  AEE  |
|  EAE  |  AEE  |  AII  |  IAI  |
|  AII  |  EIO  |  OAO  |  EIO  |
|  EIO  |  AOO  |  EIO  |       |

Modern Square of Opposition:

```
A --- E
| \ / |
|  X  |
| / \ |
I --- O
```

- **A<->O**: Contradiction
- **E<->I**: Contradiction
- **A<->E**: Undetermined
- **E<->O**: Undetermined
- **O<->I**: Undetermined
- **I<->A**: Undetermined
- Example: If you know proposition A to be true, then you know proposition O to be false.
- Example: If you know proposition A to be true, then you do not know whether proposition E is true or false.

Forms:

- **AAA**: e.g. All dogs are animals.  All animals are living beings.  Therefore, all dogs are living beings.


- Universals is the set that contains all members of that set

### Argument

```
A All physical things are particulars (E.G. This pen is a particular pen.  It does not represent the class of all markers.  It's one marker.)
E No universals are particulars
E No universals are physical things
Conversion: No physical things are universals

E No physical things are universals
I Some concepts are universals
O Some concepts are not physical things

O Some concepts are not physical things
A All concepts are in the mind
O Some (things) in the mind are not physical things
Translated: Some things in the mind are not physical

O Some things in the mind are not physical
A All things in the mind are part of the mind
O Some part of the mind is not physical
Translated to I** Some part of the mind is immaterial

**Contradiction** 
- **I** Some part of the mind is not physical
- **E** No part of the mind is immaterial (materialism thesis)
```
