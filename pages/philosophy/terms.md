- **Occam's razor**: "More things should not be used than are necessary."  Occam's razor only applies when the simple explanation and complex explanation both work equally well. If a more complex explanation does a better job than a simpler one, then you should use the complex explanation.  Note: Occam's razor is not a law, foundational principle, or axiom of logic and is more of a guideline or "rule of thumb".
- **Coherentism**: A theory of epistemic justification that implies that for a belief to be justified it must belong to a coherent system of beliefs.
- **Foundationalism**:

Deductive Reasoning
- If the premises are true you will reach an absolute certain conclusion
- e.g. if A=B and B=C therefore A=C (mathematics, logic)
- truths we can reach by mere thougts and reason, etc)

Inductive Reasoning
- If the premises are true you will reach a probable conclusion but it is not certain (e.g. black swans)
- farmer feeds chickens but one day kills them for food example
- probable truths reached through experience and percieving how the world works and reaching conclusions this way
- Problem of Induction: with inductive reasoning you can never reach certain knowledge, just probable conclusions based on previous experiences
