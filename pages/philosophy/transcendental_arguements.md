# Transcendental Arguements

Transcendental/Preconditions - things we cannot emperically verify but are presupposed in the way humans interact with the world and are absolutely necessary for even
the possibility of even having knowledge at all in this world.  They are related to emperical investigation in that they are presupposed in the investigation.  Does
that mean we can not know/prove these things?  No, the transcendental arguement handles this because it is an argument that the denial of these preconditions leass to
absurdity.
 
Examples of presuppositions:
- space-time: humans experience the world from beginning to middle to end in a spatio-temporal ever-present now
- logic:
- self: can not emperically demonstrate you have a self, it is presupposed in all actions of cognition/communication/noetics/ratiocination/etc.
- words/meaning: words have meaning and can convey meaning to other persons.  Theres no emperical verification that you are transmitting the right meaning to another brain/grey-matter.
- the past: it is assumed in how humans experience time and space
- universals: no emperical verification of universal categories, invariant concepts, numbers, etc.
- ethics: 

So in the case of God, the Divine Mind, Logos, Jesus, etc we can ast the question: how do the above different transcendental preconditions relate to one another because
our experience of the world is not just one particular transcendental (i.e. spatio-temporal experience assumes a self having a spatio-temporal experience).  All those
preconditions work together?  How do they work together if there's not a God that holds them all together?  You need a MIND and a human mind is not enough to encapsulate all those transcendentals together in all of their different particulars in every different human being's life in existance.

GOD IS THE ULTIMATE PRECONDITION FOR ALL THE OTHER PRECONDITIONS
