# Transcendentals

- Transcendentals are concepts that MUST exist for even the possibility of humans to exist and to have knowledge.
- Transcendental can NOT be emperically proven.  In other words, they can not be seen in a microscope.
- Emperical investigation is PRESUPPOSED BY transcendentals.
- The deniel of these preconditions leads to absurdity (fundamentally the destruction of even having knowledge or arguements).
- Transcendentals are often used unintentionally to try to disprove transcendentals, which is self refuting.
- Human experience of the world can not be reduced to a single transcendental ("Oneness" or "the monad").  Human experience requires ALL transcendentals that RELATE to one another and work together.

## Example Transcendentals

- **Space**: Space is a mathematical relationship between two concepts or phenomena.  It is presupposed in human worldviews because we are beings that experience things in in relation to one another.  For example, we may sense a ball (matter-energy) is some distance (relationship) from another ball (matter-energy).  Space can not be emperically verified because our senses only detect matter/energy.  Can you reach out and touch space?
- **Time**: Time is another mathematical relationship between two concepts of phenomena, often used to denote change in matter/energy, although time can still progress even if matter/energy does not change.  Time is presupposed in human worldviews because we are beings that experience things from beginning to middle to end, although emperically we can only experience things in the ever-present now.  No one experiences things in reverse and even jumbled memories/thought-patterns are still experienced from one -> another -> another.
- **A Self**: One can not emperically demonstrate he/she has a self, it is presupposed in all actions of cognition/communication/noetics/ratiocination/etc.  No microscope is going to emperically demonstrate the self.
- **A Mind**:
- **Meaning**: Words have meaning and can convey meaning to other persons.  Theres no emperical verification that you are transmitting the right meaning to another brain.  This must be assumed.
- **The Past**: The past is a transcendental category that you can not prove emperically exists and it is assumed in how humans experience time and space.  Memories are always accessed emperically in the ever-present now, never in the past.
- **Universals**: No emperical verification of universal categories (all "X").
- **Particulars**:
- **Abstract Concepts**:
- **Identity over Time**: Concepts that are invariant (all "X" are always "X") and do not change.
- **The One and the Many**: WIP
- **Ethics**: One must assume they should value X over Y because humans inherently value value judgements.  Where in the microscope/test tube are the ethics?
- **Numbers**: WIP
- **The Laws of Logic**: WIP
- **Mathematics**: 
- **The Law of Non-Contradiction (LNC)**: An extension of logic that says a proposition cannot be both true and false.  That is, a proposition and its negation cannot both be true.  Aristotle's arguement with the sophists was the LNC can not be made false because to do so would necessarily use the LNC to try to disprove it.
- **Predicates**: WIP
- **Aristotle's Categories**: substance, quantity, quality, relation, place, time, situation, condition, action, passion
- And many more...

## Example Trancendental Relationships

- Spatio-temporal experience assumes a self that's having a spatio-temporal experience.
- When one (self) speaks/writes words that have meaning to convey that meaning to another (self) it assumes these words enter into a spatio-temporal medium for information/knowledge transfer.
- What it is to be a self is partly bound up with the past.  One is a person who has a life that began at one point in time.  One's past is partially what makes one up.
- Universals are presupposed in speaking (words have meaning) and are invariant (the concepts that make up words do not change).
