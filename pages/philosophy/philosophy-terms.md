- **Occam's razor**: "More things should not be used than are necessary."  Occam's razor only applies when the simple explanation and complex explanation both work equally well. If a more complex explanation does a better job than a simpler one, then you should use the complex explanation.  Note: Occam's razor is not a law, foundational principle, or axiom of logic and is more of a guideline or "rule of thumb".
- **Coherentism**: A theory of epistemic justification that implies that for a belief to be justified it must belong to a coherent system of beliefs.
