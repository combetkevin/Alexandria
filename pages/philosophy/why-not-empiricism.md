# Why Not Empiricism

Empiricism is a theory that states that "knowledge comes only from sensory experience".  It can be summed up in Thomas Aquinas's Peripatetic axiom: "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses" adopted from the Peripatetic school of Greek philosophy, established by Aristotle.  In response to this David Hume, an empericist skeptic philosopher, basically says if an empericist states "knowledge comes only from sensory experience" and if they are consistant then they can not believe in immaterial transcendentals.  For example, when one sees ball A hit ball B they are not actually seeing "causation" but just 2 events.  Simply put, where in this sense data, under a rock, or in a microscope does one see "causation" itself?  One doesn't therefore none of these transcendentals can be proven emperically.  Thus, extended to the modern age if one is sufficiently skeptical then one can't justify the principles upon which science is based (logic, causality, the scientific method, etc.) because the principles are not emperical and thus can not be justified.  A system built on the Peripatetic axiom inherently collapses because it cannot justify it's claims.

NEED TO LOOK INTO THESE:

- myth of the given
- problem of induction
- immateriality of universals and abstract objects
