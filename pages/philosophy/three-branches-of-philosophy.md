# Three Branches of Philosophy

These branches make up a worldview, our basic lenses of interpretation that form our understanding of the world. Like it or not, and admit it or not, we all have a worldview, even if we believe ourselves to be agnostic, since even the position of a-gnosis still implies knowledge of no knowledge or the impossibility of knowledge.  The three branches of philosophy are:

- **Epistomology**: What's true/false.
- **Ethics**: What's right/wrong.
- **Metaphysics**: What is/isn't.

Each branch implies and necessitates the other by entailment.

## Epistomology (knowledge)
- truth claims (true/false categorization)
- how we know what we know?
- where do we get our knowledge?
- how do we justify our beliefs and can they be justified?
- is all knowledge relative or are there some truths that are absolutely certain?
- levels of certainty

## Ethics (morals)
- value judgements
- how do whe know what's right/wrong? good/bad?

## Metaphysics (ontology)
- claims about existence or being
- what does it mean to exist?
- what is meaning?
- immaterial, invariant, universals, transcendentals, abstracts, identity, usality
- numbers, logic, free will, spirit in man, angels, demons, etc
- logoi

## Epistomology --> Metaphysics
- (WIP) There exists some category of things that are true, there is some classification about truth that makes it correct or appropriate as opposed to things we believe are false

## Epistomology --> Ethics
- In order to know right/wrong make a truth claim about what we know

### Ethics --> Metaphysics
- (WIP) we inherently value being

## Ethics --> Epistomology
- (WIP) Implicit in every epistemic claim and logic itself is the assumption of a value claim: that one ought to be logical, bound by objective truth claims, and truthful.  If one is not, then logic has no
 
## Metaphysics --> Epistomology
- Things that are true are universally true (else they violate the law of noncontradiction)
- ie: claims like "all knowledge is ___"
- transcendental concepts like numbers or logic

## Metaphysics --> Ethics
- (WIP) human beings by nature inherently make value judgements and decide whatâ€™s right/wrong.  All humans value making value judgements (metaethics).  We give universal status to something that we consider to be true, even if we are wrong about the truth claim.
