# Fallacies
Violations of the laws of logic.

## Strawman
Misrepresenting or constructing someone's argument to make it easier to attack.
- Jay thinks that because he's read his bible therefore God exists
- Jay thinks that the cosmological argument proves God exists

## False Cause
Presuming that a real or percieved relationship between things means that one is the cause of the other.
- The rise in sea levels and the number of films that Nicholas Cage were in per year are both rising therefore Nike Cage causes rise in sea level.
- People who take mushrooms think the see deities, spirits, and demons so that must be how Moses got his revelation at Mt. Sinai, therefore religion comes from people taking mushrooms.  1) There's no evidence Moses was doing shrooms in the desert and 2) there's no evidence the God that Moses encountered is the same as the kind of diety most people who do shrooms think they discovered.

## Slippery Slope
Asserting that if we allow A to happen, then Z will consequently happen too, therefore A should not happen.
- 

## Ad Hominem
Attacking your opponent's character or personal traits in an attempt to undermine their argument.
- 

## Special Pleading
Moving the goalposts or making up exceptions when a claim is shown to be false.
- 

## Loaded Question
Asking a question that has an assumption built into it so that it can't be answered without appearing guilty.
- 

## The Gambler's Fallacy

## Bandwagon
- **Appeal to Authority** -- 




- **Non Sequitur** -- a conclusion or statement that does not logically follow from the previous argument or statement.
- **Generic Fallacy** -- Presuming something based solely on someone's or something's history, origin, or source rather than its current meaning or context.
