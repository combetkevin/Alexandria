# Matt Dillahunty Vs Jay Dyer Debate on Theism

## Jay Dyer's View

Transcendental Arguement for God (see notes)

## Matt Dillahunty's View

* "I am not convinced a God exists" or we even need a concept of a god for knowledge to exist
* We need to define a god.  Which god?  Some gods conflict with observations from reality and we can be reasonably confident those gods dont exist.
* Proponent of Occam's razor: "Dont multiply entities uncessesarily". "I'm not going to make any more presupposions than necessary".
* Is a skeptic: "I want my model of reality to match reality as best as possible... while I am a total skeptic in the sense that I have doubts about everything and I am not absolutely certain about anything, that doesn't mean I don't have reasonable confidence in things that are based on the foundation of logic".
* "I am not convinced logic needs a justification or foundation, what are the consequences if there's not a foundation?" \~1:10:30
* I am convinced logic is reliable as are others.  The difference is that some people are convinced they found why it's reliable
* presuppositions are circular (i.e. logic is presupposed by a notion of truth which is explored by reasoning (SEE BELOW))
* I accept these immaterial concepts like logic because of a demonstration of its continued reliability (induction)
* "I am not aware of a world where there is a god, but I am aware of a world where there are people who are convinced there is a god and convinced it servers are a foundation.  Where's the demonstration for a god other than an assertion?"
* "You're presupposing an explaination for why they are absolute rather than just recognizing that they are"
* "It would only be arbitrary if I were asserting that these things are in fact absolutely inviable"
* "I have never said that the logical absolutes are in fact true and dont need justification.  I'm saying I don't see a need or any demonstration that they do need a justification". (e.g. it's the difference between I am not convinced this person is guilty and I am in fact convinced this person is innocent).
* "It's not arbitrary because I'm not offering an explaination for how they are. Im not even acknowleging that there could be an explaination for how they are.  There's been no demonstration that they require an explaination".
* Ad hoc would be providing a justification for something, but I'm saying I don't even know that there could be or that there is a justification for it
* "How could it possibly be ad hoc to say that I am not aware that there needs is or needs to be an explaination"
* "you pressupose something that does not require a foundation and yet you want to criticise my presupposition which does not say that this does not require a foundation but instead says I am not yet convinced it needs a foundation, I haven't asserted a foundation, there could be a foundation but there's been no demonstration that there is a foundation or that you have found a right one.  You have found one that is consistant with an ad hoc explaination for the foundation of logic
* You have to demonstrate that there is a necessity for a God.  Simply saying the other arguement leads to a dead end is not a demonstration of a god
* "I care whether or not things are actually true to the best that we can find out so I cant make a leap to there must be a god that serves as a foundation for logic because Im not yet convinced that logic needs a foundation"
* As a skeptic shouldnt we have a justification for things that we believe in?  Yes, as a skeptic I want to believe in as many true things and as little false things as possible and I portion my confidence level in what I believe to the available evidence for it
* the evidence of a foundation for logic: zero
* the evidence of a god serves as a foundation: zero
* the difference between I am convinced of X, I am not convinced of X, and I am convinced of not X
* my position is not the lawys of logic are absolutely inviable other than they appear to be and we should operate as if they are until there's such time as there's a demonstration when they're not.  These things continually demonstrate their usefulness (we cant have convos without them).  If they are not absolute then they are as close to anything we can possibly imagine.
* the position is not: they dont require a foundation because then I would have to defend that assertion
* jay and matt agree that there is at least one thing that does not require a foundation

to say "I am not yet convinced that logic needs a foundation" presupposes

Jay is correct.

I am not aware of a world where there is no god. However, I am aware of a world where there are people who are convinced there is no god and convinced it is coherent.

As a skeptic, I want my model of reality to conform with reality as best as possible.  I am convinced logic is reliable.  I am not yet convinced nor has it been demonstrated that logic does not require a mind.  I have not yet seen any evidence that the physical destruction of a particular mind or minds destroys the laws of logic.  Thus the logic can not be it's own foundation, because it inherently assumes a mind within it's own processes.  I am not yet convinced a foundation is not necessary because

* We all have worldviews which function on 3 basic philosophic approaches to life: metaphysics, ethics epistemology
* Each of these 3 branches are intertwined with the other.
* These 3 categories are transcendentals (e.g. induction, laws of logic, the past, identity over time, the self, regularity in nature, words have meaning, telos, numbers) which are not the immediate perview of emperical sense data.  They are immaterial, invariant, conceptual, and abstract.
* The scientific method assumes many transcendentals that can not be proven by emperical sense data
* If one were to adopt a naive empericist or logical positivist view, we end up with the inability to understand/justify the belief in these transcendentals
* One could say they dont think we have to justify these transcendentals, but at that point we would be being arbitrary because we would be believing in things we dont have any justification for (philosophic justification: warrented beliefs, justifying true beliefs/proposition).  Thus we are relying on things that are immaterial that we can not justify.
* There are a whole bunch of things we assume in our lives that are not physical, pragmatic, or immediatly justified or known by sense data or naive empericism.  If we are to be a skeptic we would have to admit there's not a justification for induction, regularity in nature (David Hume).  Thus there is no justification epistemically/logically/rationally for the scientific method itself (Bertrand Russel, Willard Van Orman Quine), thus they have to just be a given.  This is an admission of the intellectual bankruptcy of the logical positivist position.
* All of these categories or transcendental preconditions could be explained perfectly in a worldview where God exists (specifically the Orthodox Theology/Christology)
* God has a Divine Mind (omnipotent, omnipresent, etc.) and thus reality has its grounding and basis in the Mind of God (Logos/Logoi) which Platonism is kindof like
* The essenses and universals that exist are ultimately grounded in the Mind of God.  That makes sense why these transcendentals are, e.g.:
  * regularity in nature due to God's providence
  * the one and the many is solved by our doctrine of the Trinity and more specifically by the Logos(Christ) and the logoi(the rational principles operant in nature
  * human dignity and ability to know OBJECTIVE truth because we are made in the image of God
* Thus Truth is more than just a pragmatic function, it's actually a transcendant quality: it's objective (not a social construct)
* We could remove all that and say "I dont buy any of that and it's a bunch of logical leaps and the only thing that exists out there is matter in motion", but that would lead to absurd contradictory conclusions
* If the Mind of God is the basis of all reality then we have the basis for all these abstract, obtuse, mathematical principles that we know are real but ar not physical
* Thus ethics, metaphysics, epistemology make sense in a worldview where God exists
* In a worldview of pure materialism, pure pragmatism, random chance, chaos, there's nothing like invariant, immaterial, conceptual law-like things... they're just social constructs.
* If there isnt a justification for logical laws, mathematical principles, etc. and they're things we just use and that work but that would be arbitrary
* When we debate we're presupposing univeral categories/laws and that doesn't allow us to be arbitrary

## Matt 10 Min #1

* Agrees we all have a worldview of these abstract concepts and they're all intertwined
* Disagrees with "it's arbitrary to say we can't justify the things we presuppose".
* There are reasons why we have justification to think that something is reasonable, but the recognition that we don't necessarily know what guarentees that is not arbitrary.  It's an acknowledgement that humans throughout history haven't been able to come up with something that is demonstratably a guarantor of logic, dignity, etc.
* A worldview that includes a belief in a God that could serve as a guarantor for all these concepts makes the world make sense.  But that's about a belief in a God that does that and you can substitute the word "god" with anything.  BELIEF that there is a justifyable foundation serves as a justifyable foundation and it's circular.
* You're assuming there is some sort of foundation
* Dont see any path to absolute certainty or point at something that says "this guarentees all these concepts are always universlly correct".  They appear to be universally correct and our reliance on them continually demonstrate their reliability in the sense that we are not dead
* The only thing we can do is interact with the reality that we have
* Big proponent of Occam's Razor (dont multiply entities unecessarily)
* I pressuppose there's a reality which I share which I can't prove/justify (aka not a proponent of solipsism) because solipsism appears to be far more absurd than the likelihood that Jay and I are sharing a reality
* The only thing that came close to how we get to a God is essentially a worldview without a god leaves us without answers to this (these transcendentals), but a worldview with a God gives us answers.  However, this presupposes that the type of answers that you're getting from a god are actually answers and that there is some explaination.
* Is it possible for something to just be the way it is?  That X is true without some sort of external justification/guarantor?  Because if that's the case...
* presuppositionalism is circular: logical laws (identity, noncontradiction, excluded middle, etc) is presupposed by truth but if I want to justify there is truth(and a reality) then I still have to exercise reason to reach that conclusion so we're back to logical laws.
* So when we talk about whether something is true we ASSUME there must be some explaination for this
* This admission, that I don't have an explaination for why there is truth, or is there truth, or why the laws of logic apparently absolute and inviable, isn't an admission of intellectual bankruptcy but what appears to be the case.
* The arguements for God are held up on the notion that there is in fact an explaination, however I have seen no arguement or evidence that there is in fact an explaination.  You can phrase it as "intellectual bankruptcy" but I phrase it as being "intellectually honest" in that I'm not going to make any more presupposions than necessary.  I'm not going to say it would be really nice if there was something that could serve as a foundation for logic, morality, human dignity, etc, except I don't know if there are foundations for those, I don't know that they all may be true, there's been no demonstration that there MUST be some foundation beyond the laws of logic.  If you argue a God solves that problem the only reason it does is because modern theological definitions of God include this thing that God doesn't need a justification
* Thus we have these things that may/may not have a justification.  We're not aware of what that justification could be.  Then we argue for something that hypothetically could serve as that justification and maybe just believing it exists serves as a satisfier but not a guarantor.  In spite of that we're stuck with how did we come up with this thing that serves as an explaniation for nothing and needs no explaination for itself.

* There are many transcendental categories: identiry of objects over time, value judgements, interperative frameworks, problem of one and the many, meaning in language, words, temporal-spatial relations, the past, numbers, causality, telos, rights, freedom, the self, reasoning, logic, belief in external world, etc
* All these transcendentals are not just presupposed in all of scientific methodology, but in life in general (i.e. the self is not emperically verifyable.  It is assumed in the process of arguing for or against it)
* These transcendentals are outside the perview of mere sense data and sense experience, however they are related to sense experience in that they are presupposed
* All these transcendental categories if they are to be made coherent and sensible (Jay believes in coherent view of truth and justifying claims, not a classical foundationalist view in terms of epistemology) in the worldview in which there is a God that's presented according to Otrhodoc Christianity
* God is the grounds and the coherence or what strings all these many pearls of transcendentals together.  God is the personal One who does this and because Hes personal, not an immaterial abstract impersonal force like a law of logic or "thought thinking itself", which makes reality itself at a fundamental level personal and not meaningless dead matter.
* evil presupposes some standard by which we judge good and evil
* In my worldview, God is the ultimate presupposition.  Yes, Jay is presupposing the existance of God.  Because I believe in that coherentance view of truth in the world, it's impossible for me not to have some final circular authority that I appeal to which is ultimately going to be God and that's not inconsistant with the philosophy I'm promoting: coherentism (not classical foundationalism, which out of the enlightenment leads to athiest/materialist perspective)
* There is nothing wrong with saying God is my ultimate foundation in my woldview and I am presupposing it and I compare it Matt's presuppositions
* Matt should go the route of Hume and say that truth and induction can't be justified, and not only that we have to use all these things that don't make sense on our worldview
* Hume and others" there's not a rational/logical justification for these things that we use in an empericist worldview and if there's not then we dont have a reason or basis to debate itself.  Debate presopposes some common notion of truth, ability to communicate truth that isnt material, words have meaning that are conceptual in some way that go beyond vocal cords/electricity and actually convey information.
* Information science suggests that we dont find meaningful information being trasfered anywhere that's not from a mind
* even more fundamental than numbers, or concept of information or words is all these transcendental categories that are presupposed in communication/life/logic/ethics and make sense in a paradigm/worldview where we have the kind of God we believe in
* Denying transendentals would lead to fundamental self contradictory positions that lead to the destruction of philosophy as a whole
* If we're going to talk about justifying our beliefs and being rational and giving a coherent account of our beliefs then we cant really prove the existance of the past, the self (a transcendental unity that underlies all these perceptions/sense data from our emperical experiences)
* When we dont have the presupposition of God and we dont start with that, then we're inevitably led down these paths to dead ends in philosophy, and total contradictions
* For example if one were to say maybe solipism isnt a contradiction and everything is just a phenomena of my mind, then we would be led to the conclusion that everything happening is just illusary or a phenomena of passing ghost and if that's the case then my coming to know the truth of solipsism is also part of the solipsist maze/mirror/illusion and thus would also be contradictory

## Matt 10 Min #2

* Not a fan of labels, but is fine with "truth is that which comports to reality" as opposed to coherence view of truth
* We begin in debate with a common ground of assumptions and debate the things that are not common ground
* Is there a foundation behind this or some justification for thinking there is a foundation, or is there a circular appeal to the god presupposition that we talk about
* Occams Razor is dont multiply entities uncessesarily.  To say "God did it" feels simple and therefor comports to occams razor
* Whether or not we can justify those things that we agree on, I'm not convinced that we can otherwise there wouldnt be a debate
* What I see is "your worldview cant justify this and therefore you have no grounds to say anything or do anything else".  It seems to me that somebody is saying "you can't be absolutely certain even if you could be reasonably certain"
* I dont think you can be absolutely certain about anything \~45:33
* I describe maximal certainty: if I begin with there is a reality and the laws of logic appear to be inviolate (and I will revise that the moment someone can demonstrate the laws of logic can be violated or dont always apply).  But then everything that is deductively arrived from those like methematics I would say you can be maximally certain about because the deduction from logic leads to the same level.  Other things are inductively derived and they have a lower standard of certainty or lower confidence level
* Maximal could be absolute.  If the laws of logic are absolute then maximal becomes absolute.  It's just I dont have any way to demonstrate that.
* I live in a world and I dont think I can be absolutely certain about anything (NOTE: inherently self refuting lol... either absolutly certain he cant be absolutely certain (self refuting) or not absolutely certain he cant be absolutely certain(also self refuting)), but that doesnt mean that I'm in a state of chaos and can't determine anything.  I live in a world that is aparently reasonable
* Science doesnt make proclaimations about truth or claim any sort of certainty.  It says this is our tentative conclusions based on the current evidence and is always subject to revision.
* The coherent model of truth: truth is coherent with a set of propositions and one of the propositions you're including is that these things have a foundation.  That is pre proposition that I reject.  I'm not saying it's false.  I cant demonstrate that they dont have a foundation.  I'm just saying that there has been no demonstration that they do.  I dont see any reason why these things (transcendentals) arent true in-and-of-themselves in much the same way that people can argue that God doesnt need a foundation in-and-of-itself.  If there's no way to demonstrate that this could have been any other way then we're on good ground in saying the laws of logic have to be absolute or it's a reasonable not-wuite-maximally-certain inference from the direct observations and it appears these tools (transcendentals) provide a consistant understanding of reality.
* You can construct a justification for anything

## Great Chat Quotes

The transcendental arguement is not saying that there is a God just because He is a self-evident (foundationalism).  If this is so then one could make the claim that logic, reality, or the self is self-evident.  However, TAG says that there are immaterial and invariant concepts (transcendentals) EVERYONE assumes in his/her life and worldview.  These transcendentals must relate to one another in some way in order for even the possibility to have knowledge.  Thus God provides the most coherent worldview to separate and relate these claims.

One could claim that it is self-evident these transcendentals inherently relate to one another (impersonal forces), however at that point I would have to ask for justification.

TAG provides the most coherent view

* ​If there is no justification for logic, how can you even know logic exists?
* This is the problem Jay is facing. Even if he can show that Matt's position is flawed, he still hasn't demonstrated that a god exists.
* ​Is it possible, in any world, for you to construct a concept of "self" if you, as the thinking entity which is constructing this concept, do not exist a priori?
* ​Epistemology is required to make sense of anything. If your epistemology breaks down, then you cannot speak meaningfully.  ​Your epistemology breaks down when viewed at a paradigmatic level, the Orthodox Christian epistemology doesn't. Jay can speak, you cannot.
* ​The foundation of Matt’s belief is himself, he is the arbiter of truth...and he could be wrong about that
* ​Reliability of senses is a presupposition
* ​If determinism is true there exists nothing but determined events. Hence knowledge-claims are determined. Hence knowledge-claims cannot be justified.
* ​You need a presupposition of truth to have logic you nobbs
* By entering the debate Matt already admitted defeat since he needs to accept non-mateiral universal laws of logic necessary for debate. (note, matt seems ok with immaterial concepts so he's not a materialist, HOWEVER, he can not give a justification for them and isn't convinced there needs to be a justification for them... an obvious response would be "well, where's ur evidence for immaterial concept X")
* Atheists be like: I’m an empiricist but my worldview is also completely dependent on unprovable assumptions (agian Matt doesnt seem to be a strict empericist)
* Coherentism allows for degrees of truth, but at paradigmatic level of analysis only one paradigm can be coherent.
* Anyone who tries to admonish another is trying to bring the mind of the other into conformity with objective truth. Therefore to argue for a position is to espouse absolutism. Or thought is meaningless
* Don’t reduce entities unnecessarily either. (in regards to Occams Razor.  YES!)
* ​Dude, the whole thing is centered around comparing worldviews. You're only presupposing that empiricism is true and then you ask for material evidence as if there are no other ways of proving things.
* "I don't think we can be absolute certian on anything" - Matt. That is an absolute certian statement.
* You have to presuppose the existence of a world to observe and that observations are correct to even get to empiricism. "I'm not making claim" says the low IQ atheist.
* Denying absolute truth is self contradicting. (Yes, saying "I deny absolute truth" is making an absolute truth claim about absolute truth)
* Matt has already stated that he has to presuppose things like induction, that he can not disprove solipsism though he finds it deeply counter intuitive and a poor explanation for phenomena
* ​He’s giving you the syllogism it’s believing in god because that gives you the most coherent worldview. That’s it.
* atheism does not demand certaibnty that there is no god
* your trying to create ridiculous scenarios you know you can’t back up to try to distract us . Since your claiming someone created God then back it up

His weasel word is he “haven’t seen a demonstration that a foundation is needed” when Jay demonstrated that without a foundation you can’t truly be sure the abstract transcendentals you use like logic are intelligible he doesn’t see that as a demonstration for a need for a foundation BECAUSE REASONS!!!!!!!!

the atheistic worldview is inherently unable to justify coherently all of the Transcendental properties and preconditions that we use in everyday life. Each time they give an explanation of those, they lead to absurdity.

But you're being arbitrary. "It just is." Isn't an argument. If it's just matter in motion, then you're not making arguments right not you're just a bundle of forced chemical processes. So am I. Therefore, my chemicals are better than your chemicals. I win.

That's what Coherentist theory of truth is about. It is circular, at the base level it's going to be circular. But if it wasn't circular it would be absurd. So the choice is absurdity or circularity.

No, it's not bizarre. In order for y to be true, what would x have to be? y is true, therefore x. It's a basic logical argument.

when we engage in philosophical discussions we inheretly assume transcendentals

you're making things more complicated than they are. Both debaters presupose logic, otherwise the debate wouldn't be possible. TAG is merely pointing out that the skeptical position has no coherent justification for transcendentals while the Christian position can easily account for them. Matt even said in the debate that maybe the skeptics will have a justification in the future. So he conceded the point and insisted that Jay provide evidence that justification is necessary.

Jay touched on this in the debate. There's plenty of evidence and no matter what evidence you would be given you'll still find reasons to reject it, because, as you say, the entire story seems absurd to you. You're comitting the confirmation bias fallacy.

If Skepticism were logically consistent, then you'd have to question everything.

"Logic is innate biological function to humans that is an extension of mammalian pattern recognition." ... which means that logic is neither reliable nor immutable since it is the result of a random process. So you not only cannot prove that, if what you say is true you cant make truth claims at all.

> Your comment illustrates why calling TAG proof is bizarre.  The entire of the debate is that you're questioning the justification of logic itself.  Then you're claiming to have "proved" logic via a logical argument. It would be no different than a mathematician trying to "prove" the foundations of math via a mathematical argument, the impossibility of  which is what the very example Jay gives of Goedel's incompleteness theorem is meant to illustrate.
> We're not questioning the justification of logic itself. We're questioning the justification of logic on Non-Orthodox worldviews. In our worldview logic is assumed. So we're not trying to prove logic via logic. That's misunderstanding the argument.
> yes, logic is in question here, nobody denied the fundamental circularity of having to prove logic using logic. But logic is not the only transcendental in question here. As Jay pointed out in the debate, being consistent in skepticism leads to absurdity.

There are no shared observations of human beings. You can't share someone else's observations. Therefore if consistent, you'd be a Solipsist. But you cannot prove your own observations aren't just a mental illusion. So you can't prove anything, yet again. TAG wins.

Jay uses Matt's own system, that logic doesn't need a justification, to show where the absurdities begin. Okay, so we just assume logic as our worldview, but doesn't that assume value judgments? Yes. How do we determine value judgments? How is it that the universe is consistent to allow value judgments and logic in the first place? Is that actually the case? Mereology is an assumption.  Jay isn't saying he is in a complete box by himself btw, isolated in a worldview where he has no actual connection to the here and now. No presuppostionalist says that. We all share this reality together, that's the argument. They are realists. Presups doesn't lead to solipsism, it's anti solipsism

> TAG is not a semantic trap. Skeptics have a bottom up approach to understand reality: they observe the fallen state of the world and they argue backwards reading the present into the past and arriving at the conclusion that God cannot exist because His existence would be unlike anything we know from personal experience, which is not saying much. The TAG starts top to bottom, and argues that God is a way to ensure the coherence of the entire system of transcendental categories. I don't believe TAG proves there is no other possible system which could account for that, so it's weak in that sense, but I don't see another competing worldview with more explaining power. Saying "we don't know but it works" doesn't explain much. I'm pretty sure Jay mentioned both the circularity aspect and the worldview comparison as a standard of determining which worldview is true, in this debate.
> I never said TAG is a semantic trap.  It's based on a worldview which requires a metalogic wherein logic itself can and must be justified.  If your interlocutor does not already subscribe to such a worldview, then all you've done is offer a logical justification of logic itself.  Yet the premise of the debate is comparing worldviews.

I don't believe logic operates on its own, or that we can't use language to talk about things beyond logic. Just because logic is used first, or seemingly first in the order of operations, doesn't mean it actually is. Ethics is not logic, yet we can only talk about it in logical terms to each other and arguably has to precede logic. Metaphysics isn't logic, yet precedes logic.

It's not a canard, God is literally in the acronym lmao. We are showing without revelation, everything is arbitrary. That's always been what we say at the outset. That's TAG vro. Philosophy doesn't save but it sure can point out inconsistencies.

"Occam's razor" is nothing.  It was just Occam's opinion, essentially.  Not a law, not a foundational principle, not an axiom of logic.  Materialists treat it like an actual principle which must not be violated, but it isn't.  In fact, it's extremely vague, leaving the standards of "necessity" or "simplicity" to be defined by whoever is attempting to use it as a rhetorical weapon.

Ockhamism/Nominalism is the revolutionary philosophical project that tore down all of philosophy. It just leads to metaphysical anti-realism and inevitably to epistemological anti-realism.

The way I understand it (Occam's razor) is that we shouldn't add anything unnecessary.

You can have "too much skepticism." That's called denialism. It's when you are so attached to your beliefs you can't accept any evidence against them. And yes, many antitheists qualify as denialists.

It's a common mistake for people to believe that Matt thinks that God doesn't exist. There's an important difference between "God doesn't exist" and "I don't believe you when you say God exists".

STUDY 1:50:42

Wow, the answers given to the question asked on 1:50:42 perfectly explains why these two are having such a hard time understanding each other.

If you do not have any foundations for the transcendental categories you employ in reason, and simply accept them arbitrarily, you are implicitly binding your intellect within a gnostic worldview. "Free thinker"? "Skeptic"? Time to level up, buddy!

How can a free thinker, or a skeptic, honestly continue to make arguments when they don't have a coherent system that provides a justification of the transcendental categories they use? Jay provides a coherent system involving the Eastern Orthodox faith in God. Jay has a superior integrated intellect to any atheist, and atheists lack the tools necessary even to argue with him. I am not Orthodox, and I am skeptical of any religion. Honestly, I'd like to see a good argument against Jay. Jay does not invoke any god, but the particular God revealed throughout the Orthodox tradition. I'd like to see if similar coherent systems exist for another "god", even if that "god" is a transcendent physical principle.

As an analogy, imagine being a geometer doing geometry assuming Euclid's axioms - because it works, and there is no evidential reason not to. You are bound within Euclidean's geometry. In actual fact, we know that the universe is not Euclidean. This only happened because true free thinkers, questioned EVERYTHING! They did not invoke Occam's razor, "why introduce a need to justify the axioms, when it is not needed..."
I'm sorry - it is like you are saying to Gauss, show me a Euclidean triangle with angles that don't sum to 180 degrees.

You're accepting a false null hypothesis as a de facto state and resting your laurels on Skepticism i.e. a philosophy of Type 2 Errors. There's nothing intellectually impressive about always denying perceptions/experiences of reality as a means to appear have a false confidence level toward a narrow view of reality.  As Jay points out in the debate, you run into the problem with this worldview being a circular dead-end as all observations of reality can be skeptically disregarded/inconclusive and thus we're left with the useless "I don't know" stance like Matt had for virtually every epistemological, ethical and metaphysical question. However, this is always practiced selectively (tactical nihilism) as rarely do we see atheist skeptics not share common core values and epistemological and ethical beliefs: primarily that of skepticism itself but also of progressivism, secularism, individualism, materialism, reductionism, etc et al.

In my response, I’m gonna assume you have some knowledge of epistemology and specifically the topic of the structure of justification. Epistemic justification is the third element which when combined with true belief, confers justification.

Internalists like Matt, take epistemic justification in a deontological sense, that one is epistemically justified in holding a belief if one has fulfilled his epistemic duties and obligation, thus being within his rights to hold said belief. If one holds a belief without justification, he is committing a wrongdoing, he is blameworthy for such poor epistemic behavior and ought not to believe. This is the line as to what beliefs one may or may not hold. When Matt holds beliefs without fulfilling such epistemic duties and obligations, like having access to epistemically relevant reasons for belief, evidence for the belief, reflection on the belief’s epistemic status, etc., he is morally culpable. So Matt shouldn’t be holding the belief that there is a logos in Being.

Jay can hold said belief, because (for the internalist), he has fulfilling his epistemic duties and obligations in having a good enough reason to hold such a belief; God emanating logos through his creation. Jay is a coherentist. He’s sees the infinite regress problem of justification not terminating in basic, foundational beliefs, but that beliefs form a web of mutually-supporting beliefs out of which emerges epistemic justification at some degree. Thus when some conditions are fulfilled within this web of beliefs, where belief in God’s existence is included, said beliefs attain justification. These conditions vary greatly amongst coherentists (so much so, that’s it’s too lengthy and complicated to explain here). I don’t personally espouse this view, I like Plantinga’s views on epistemic justification more which are externalist and “neo”-foundationalist, and MacIntyre’s view on rationality. So yes, God is justified in Jay’s view of things and Matt’s epistemology is definitely incoherent and confused. He fails to understand the nature of the kind of justification which he himself espouses, notably the necessity of fulfilling epistemic duties and obligations as an internalist.

Moral culpability in holding unjustified beliefs stems from the failure of the internalist in fulfilling his epistemic duties and obligations and thus being an epistemically irresponsible agent. You don't want to be an epistemically irresponsible agent, that's why Matt is blameworthy for being one. Matt shouldn't believe that there is logos in Being if he can't justify that belief, because to do so is epistemically irresponsible. Jay, if his internalist coherentism is correct, isn't being an epistemically irresponsible agent because his belief in God supports his belief in logos in Being. And I did explain how a belief in God can support a belief in logos in Being (logic). God as creator and ground of Being, emanates logos through Being via his divine intelligence. This is why there is intelligible form and order in Being. This doctrine of emanation goes back to Middle and Neo-Platonism.

Not every set of beliefs are circular. Foundationalists argue that the regress of beliefs terminates in basic, foundational beliefs which are justified non-inferentially (justified from things other than beliefs). Philosophers have debated as to what the nature of these properly basic beliefs are for centuries. Some take them to be indubitable, indefeasible, and incorrigible (Descartes). Others take a more moderate view and think they just ought to be strongly-suggested, but defeasible beliefs (Thomas Reid). My particular view on foundationalism is that of Plantinga and Reid. I like Plato too. There are other positions as to what the structure of justification is other than foundationalism and coherentism. There's contextualism, pragmatism, and virtue epistemology as well.

Dude you don't know anything about epistemology. It's actually painful reading your responses. Please go actually read and study philosophers as opposed to having all your awareness of the topic coming from YouTubers. People have solved the is-ought problem, go read Aristotle, Aquinas, and MacIntyre. You don't know what epistemic duties and obligations even are. You don't know what epistemic justification is. You don't know what other positions on any of these topics are. You still don't understand moral culpability being tied to epistemic justification for internalists. You probably don't know what internalism or externalism even is.

Basically Matt's positions is that his presuppositions are unjustified and that he's not even sure if presuppositions can be justified.

Based on this position all possible arguments Matt could make that rely on those presuppositions turn from arrows into soap bubbles, they aren't binding upon anyone - if the presuppositions don't have to be justified, why does anything ever have to be justified? How could he argue to someone in a debate that they should back up their assertions? Jay is right that this is a very fundamental and meta-level question and it takes a while to see that it either upholds or dissolves everything else in the worldview. Matt might argue "We know that other normative and everyday arguments can be justified (such as the card game example) and so they should be", but 1) those possible justifications ultimately rely on fundamental presuppositions which for him haven't themselves been justified and therefore could be completely arbitrary, and 2) how does he know that things ought to be justified? Yet another presupposition that on his worldview may not even be justifiable. It's a hollow basis for a worldview based on which you can't even engage in debate.

I wouldn't just assert that a presupposition is binding, I would demonstrate it. Consider the presupposition that non-material non-empirical entities exist. If whoever denies the validity of the presupposition is employing the use of non-material non-empirical laws (such as logical laws) in their argument, then it is binding upon them to accept the existence of non-material non-empirical things, otherwise they are engaging in an internal contradiction. Therefore no, people are not able to disagree; under such circumstances the attempt to voice a disagreement would instantly assume the validity of what is being denied.

It's not a question of not agreeing on any beliefs, it's a question of whether those beliefs are justified in our respective worldviews. If you can't justify a presupposition or if you claim that it doesn't require justification, don't expect people to accept your justifications and arguments based on that presupposition, since that is an arbitrary application of a standard of truth. If you can arbitrarily pick and choose what warrants a justification, I could choose that I don't have to justify a response to your arguments and you would have no basis on which to object.

In my opinion, Matt doesn't quite understand the need for paradigmatic context.

It's pretty evident that Matt wanted to frame the debate in such a way that he got to play the neutrality card. He consistently says I am not making any claims, and I am just not convinced that you have a warranted belief.

Unfortunately, Matt doesn't seem to recognize that these propositions themselves are only meaningful within some context, and thus they presuppose things about metaphysics, epistemology, and axiology. From this it follows that when Matt says he's not convinced of some claim he is implicitly making assertions about the world, and therefore he is not neutral.

But in making no claim on the God question, you make implicitly through logical entailment several other claims on numbers of other Epistemological/Metaphysical/Ethical/Logical things. That's where we utilize TAG arguments. Because we don't believe you can divorce one question from a system. If you deny the existence of God, it has logical implications. Just like denying the existence of the external world, or truth has logical implications.

The definition of hubris came from the ancient Greeks: defiance of the gods. Atheism is by definition hubris.

This is not even a debate. One party has a cohesive world view, from the most fundamental level to all observed phenomena. The other party acknowledges that it has no cohesive view; just a set of observations that do not tie together, but which apparently can be trusted without any foundation or justification. But it's okay, someday this view will find its justification

I love how Matt appeals to Logic by saying “a lot of people use it and it works” but a theist who makes the same claim about God is foolish and superstitious. Even funnier than that is the persistent claim that “I’m not convinced Logic needs a foundation” then proceeds to give it a foundation (because he is aware it needs one) by using two back to back logical fallacies “a lot of people believe it and it works”. Logic with no foundation is relative and therefore ought to have no relationship/corollary with reality and yet it does. Thus the transcendental argument.

yeah that's not how scripture defines it. It says every belief must have reason.
you're referring to Hebrews 1:11; "Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see." There's plenty of things you don't see that you're assured of. But to say it is without reason or evidence ignores that scripture argues and gives evidence and reasons for faith and how it speaks of faith in toto.
"But in your hearts revere Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with gentleness and respect,"
1 Peter 3:15

"A lot of people use it (logic) and it works"

the thing about "it functions" is that it's contingent upon whether or not a function is socially or naturally constructed. for example, my body isn't functioning right if it's keeping me alive, and it's function is to die. If it's naturally constructed, and one agrees that it's 'functioning' properly, wouldn't that suggest some kind of teleology out there?  if you say no, then the word refers to nothing real unless you believe that social constructs are real; ...which they could very well be.  If my body came into being through some random process grounded in no type of design, current evidence seems to suggest that it's unlikely that our languages can accurately represent the external world; it just allows the 'bodies' to sustain 'form' long enough to produce offspring. In fact, I would argue that it's just a simple series of grunts and motions that cause conditioned responses. But if mind or consciousness is a transcendent fundamental, our logic and mathematics might at least be grounded enough to lead us to a higher or even ultimate truth & how it relates to real being.

"The point is that transcendental arguments are used to examine the validity of fundamental presuppositions. The laws of logic are one example of such a presupposition. The transcendental argument comes in when someone attempts to argue against the presupposition. In this case that would involve denying or doubting the laws of identity and non-contradiction which are laws of logic. To even attempt to make an argument against such laws in the first place inexorably assumes the validity of both laws. Therefore it is impossible to argue against the laws of logic. That is why Jay characterises this type of argument as impossible to argue against and as the strongest possible type of justification."

 

"Proving" or "disproving" the existence of deities doesn't make any sense if the worldviews via which that is being attempted cannot even account for intelligibility.

This is not even a debate. One party has a cohesive world view, from the most fundamental level to all observed phenomena. The other party acknowledges that it has no cohesive view; just a set of observations that do not tie together, but which apparently can be trusted without any foundation or justification. But it's okay, someday this view will find its justification (when those pesky aliens from other dimensions finally show up)!

The Universe/Multiverse does not need an explanation even though it's a natural entity but somehow a supernatural being namely God has to have one. Unless the Universe/Multiverse is somehow a supernatural being then it needs an explanation.

The history of debate centres around there being an affirmation and a negation. Either the transcendental categories need a justification, or they do not. There is no other ontological option. The debate would then be purposed to explore these two options. If we explore the option that they do not need a justification, we will wind up in absurdity as Jay has pointed out. But if we explore the option that they do need a justification we will be led to a worldview where God is present.

 

I would say I’ve not been presented with evidence that a god(s) exist but am open to it. Until then I don’t believe in a god or gods, what ever you want call that I’m probably fine with.

 

\- Making a positive claim (I know the sun does exist)

\- Making a negative claim (I know the sun doesn't exist)

\- Not making a claim (I don't know if the sun does or does not exist).

If all knowledge is chemical reaction then all distinctions are arbitrary.﻿

That's what's so hilarious about these ridiculous discussions. There is absolutely no logical end to it all. Once you've rejected the idea that humans have souls or are in some way set apart from animals, it becomes impossible to survive if you follow that to its logical conclusion and actually behave accordingly, for the simple reason that you can no longer eat.

It took me well over a year to start to warm to this idea. It required me thinking that sentience might play a very small role in what we actually are, almost impossibly small. Just imagine slowly reducing the inputs of your mind all the way down to near zero, no memories no thoughts just a little light that comes on and goes off but nothing else. What is existence 'like' at that point? Certainly it's like something, however boring it is compared to what I experience now, but is the feeling of being sentient any different? We use a lot of colorful language to describe sentience but perhaps it's just a really small benign thing that happens whenever information is processed?

Electrochemical signaling is just a mechanism of information processing. It doesn't matter what mechanism they use, what matters is whether they have the right type of information processing to form internal representations. There is some fairly complex signaling going on in mycelium networks, but we have a very poor understanding of it.

That's why the social contract idea has gone stale. It was useful back when the idea of "opting out" was even remotely possible, and there existed land "outside" of civilization. Now there isn't a piece of dirt in the world which isn't at least theoretically governed by a state.

You see a version of it in the UK re: YOLO and taxes. Many younger people are opting to spend their wages on 'experiences' rather than material items or property (because it's so expensive). They either rent or live at home with mum and dad; they've opted out of the 'British dream' (of owning one's own home). Some people are also opting to earn just enough to survive on (pay the bills, eat etc) but not pursue the maximum wealth they might be able to achieve. If their income doesn't exceed a certain amount, they don't pay any tax at all. Essentially, they've opted out. Taken to an extreme eventuality, only the people still playing the game will be paying taxes on it (whilst bemoaning how much tax they're paying). Everyone's trying to opt out of the social contract just a little bit. Yet complaining that our public services aren't up to scratch and crying foul at others who are trying to avoid it in their own way.

Every worldview is circular.  Basing your beliefs on experience is circular.  Classical foundational epistemology fails at a fundamental level.  People like you are just not philosophically sophisticated enough to realize this.  You think that "I experience it" is sufficient (it isn't). In fact, empiricism even fails at circularity.  Empiricism can not justify itself, and things like induction and the regularity of nature are just axiomatically assumed. So, if all worldviews are circular (they are), then what matters is coherence and explanatory power.  Naturalism/materialism fails miserably on both of these aspects.

there are certain baseline, fundamental assumptions we all must make in order to  conduct reasoning and acquire knowledge. Positing a supernatural being or entity, or appealing to the bible or your favorite science fiction novel, doesn't somehow magically rescue you from this "problem", which isn't really a problem at all.  presuppositionalism amounts to nothing more than axiomatically, and correctly, boot strapping properly basic beliefs, which again we all must do, and then making the extra, unnecessary, and unwarranted leap of adding another assumption, a creator deity, and pretending that it either belongs alongside the other actually valid starting presuppositions or that it itself somehow serves as validation/justification for the others, the latter of which is even more absurd and dishonest than the former.

You don't understand Jay's argument.  He is saying all worldviews are circular and ultimately we can only compare for coherency and other such properties.

Do you not understand the argument?  All world-views are grounded in presuppositions so yes Jay's and my worldview is no different except in ours we can actually make claims of truth that are coherent in that they follow a linear regression back to god where all other worldviews are lacking in self awareness in regards to their presuppositional nature or are  self-aware but self-refuting like nihilism, i.e. making a claim of truth that there is not truth.

I've already answered your question kind sir.  Our worldview is circular in that it is still presuppositional but it is also not self-refuting and in being as such is more coherent than other world-view.  You are very confused as to what the actual argument is and why we argue in this way.   Our ability to nest our worldviews in the objective or as you think of it the experiential is limited fundamentally , any worldview that stops there will ultimately lead to incoherence hence the issues of ethics and moral philosophy since the enlightenment.    The only worldview that can give coherence is one which the presupposition is the mind of god, then truth can be traced back through a linear regression directly.

Trying to ground your beliefs on supposedly self-evident foundations - like experience, the validity of logic, or speculation about an unmoved mover - fails precisely because those things are not self-evident.  At a fundamental level, this approach to epistemology cannot account for the phenomena of reality.    So when examining fundamental worldview presuppositions, it's more useful to take an approach focused on coherence, since circulatory is unavoidable. There is no such thing as a brute fact.  Everything is interpreted.  Everything in human experience is subjective.  It is only through God's revelation that we can know Truth.

"Your logic and reason is not a foundational, properly basic belief - you need to properly account for that - but this here God proposition, no that's fine, just putting that here with my properly basic beliefs, walk on by, nothing to see here."

I apologise for assuming you're a Hitchens bot. It's the face of your community, just as the face of our community seems to be Southern Baptists.

 

I’m not sure why you think Jay was arguing against the laws of logic. As far as I can tell he was starting from the position that all world-views are ultimately circular and that all we can do is compare world-views and big narratives for coherence and correspondence.

For example paraconsistent logical systems violate non-contradiction but they are not self-refuting as they do not adhere to the principle of explosion, fuzzy logics violate the law of excluded middle and yet are not self-refuting etc. 

Steve the argument you asked Jay if he had been making is close to 400 years old. If I am correct, the  it comes from a Bishop named George Berkeley. He essentially argues that all that exists are immaterial things, and that our words refer to sets of sensations. What we mean by solid is that we have a particular visual sensation, maybe a noise, and some resistance when we try to move thru it.  If this were true though, why when we light a candle, and leave the room and come back would the candle be melted if no sensations were occurring?  Berkeley would respond by saying that all that scenario shows is that there must be one mind perceiving everything at all times. This was his argument for God.

>That's not the argument; the argument is that all worldviews need to presuppose certain things and cannot be justified by themselves, so you need to look at how coherent a worldview is in order to justify it. Jay is saying the Orthodox Christian worldview is the most coherent and therefore correct by this logic.

>Yes, but the Christian world view is still invented. Anyone can design a logically coherent system in five minutes. Christian logic may be valid, but it's not sound, that was my point.

anyone can claim "it just works".  That doesn't magically make it a coherent worldview

What's your point? Can this same criticism not be made of literally everything? 'Oh well I might be wrong about something, therefore I cannot know anything.'

You’re misrepresenting the argument.  It isn’t we just assume things therefor god it’s the existence of god makes for the most coherent world-view.  Given his first premise that all world-views are ultimately circular he is simply placing all world-views on an equal footing in regards this particular aspect of their nature and then requesting that we compare world-views to see which best explains the existence of such properties like logic, which he seems to think is best explained by his theology.

the types of arguments we would use to discuss presuppositions and pure abstractions  are necessarily different than the ones we use to talk about objects present in the temporal scene where the empirical approach yields the most clarity.

 its a fair argument if your view is that all we can do is compare and contrast for coherency and correspondence.

 

 

 

 Whistler My understanding is they are no different in this regard.  There is only segment to abstraction and the worldview which is comprised of these deferments is to some varying degree coherent or not coherent.

Here is a version of the argument:

There are necessary and eternal abstract truths like mathematical propositions such as 1+1=2 or that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle adds up to 180 degrees or the pythagorean theorem. We discovered these truths as opposed to inventing them because they are objective and unchangeable facts. These truths are not dependent on human beings or material reality. It is true that 1+1=2 before any human being ever existed and it was true before any material reality existed (i.e. the universe) and it will be true even if all human beings and material reality went out of existence. But then, what accounts for their existence? In what way do these truths exist? Well, they aren't material or physical at all. In fact, since they are abstract, the only way that they can exist are as abstract objects (or the objects of thought), which are grounded in an intellect or mind. Therefore, we must come to a necessarily existing intellect that serves as the ontological basis for the existence for these abstract objects, which are the eternal truths. And this is what we call God or the Divine Intellect.

We are not saying that "we do not know, therefore God did it." We are saying that there are certain abstract truths that can only be grounded in an intellect or mind, since they are abstract after all. But, these abstract truths are necessary truths. Thus, they must be grounded in a necessarily existing intellect. An intellect that exists in an absolutely necessary way must be purely actual because if it has some potential for existence, then it could possibly fail to exist. But, since it is impossible for something necessary to fail to exist, the necessarily existing intellect must be purely actual and devoid of all potentiality.  And so it will have all the other divine attributes that flow from what it means for something to be purely actual, like perfect goodness, omnipotence, immutability, necessity, eternality, immateriality, incorporeality, intellect, will, omniscience, unity, simplicity, the most fundamental cause of the existence of things and so on. So, this necessarily existing intellect is purely actual, one, perfect, fully good, immutable, eternal, immaterial, incorporeal, simple, omnipotent and omniscient. And this is what we call God.

Yep. The classic problem of evil. I think the problem of evil can be diffused easily simply by saying that God has reasons for allowing evil (which does not exist in itself, but is a lack of good) to occur. For example, so that human beings may value and appreciate the significance of the good, which would not be the case if the world contained no evils or suffering; so that human beings can be tested and improve ourselves in the face of gruelling challenges; some greater goods presuppose evil— for example, compassion and forgiveness could not exist if there wasn't also people who were uncompassionate and cruel; the fact that there can only be one Pure Actuality who is all-good and everything else will be lacking in goodness to some degree or another since they all contain potentialities, and so on and so on. Also, we are fully within our rights to respond to horrendous evils and the like with “I don’t know”. This response, however, does not show that there is no reason for God allowing such an evil to occur nor does it show that the God is evil. If you conclude that God is evil after we say we don’t know why he would permit such an evil, the atheist would be arguing from ignorance— just because we don’t know the reason, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t a reason. You have the burden of proof of showing that there is absolutely no reasons for why God would allow such evils to occur. But, as we have already shown, God does have reasons for allowing evil to occur, in fact it cannot logically be any other way. So, the problem of evil doesn't have much force, in my view.

a. y you would have to compare the claims of the belief systems to see if the have the same explanatory power. We make this claim for Christianity because of the specifics of its teachings, of the Trinitarian God and the incarnation and the revelations of scripture. You can’t just swap out any details and have the argument work. He’s not arguing for a generic God.

@a. y And do you believe your response is rational or is it just a determined automatic response produced by non-rational forces..? If you believe your response is rational, how do you explain rationality if free will does not exist and that which you call "you" is a determined brainstate..? If you believe your response is non-rational, how do you know if anything you believe is true ---- including the belief that God does not exist..?

I think that you have misunderstood the nature of these truths. They are necessary which means that they are true in every possible world. Also, they are not derived from the universe or some sort of experiment or observation or "the laws of the universe" (whatever that means). They are unchangeable and objective facts that would be true no matter what happens in the universe and even if the universe went out of existence tomorrow, they would still be true. This means that they are not grounded in material reality and are true independent of the universe. Also, there are other reasons why these necessary truths cannot only be grounded in material reality or human minds:

The eternal and necessary truths cannot fail to exist but contingent intellect and material things can fail to exist. No material thing has the perfection that geometric objects have; there are no perfect lines, angles, circles or spheres in material reality. So, the abstract truths that are derived from these geometric abstract objects do not depend on material reality. The series of numbers and the amount of mathematical propositions is infinite, while there are only finitely many material things and only finitely many ideas within any human mind or collection of human minds. Thus, mathematical truths cannot only depend on material reality or human minds.

I mean of course we discovered these truths. There was a point in human history when man didn't know anything about the Pythagorean theorem. But, it was still true before we knew about it. This just means that we did not invent these truths, we discover them, as they were already true before any human knew about them.

Again, I said that even if I have never had the experience of an incorporeal intellect, that would not refute any premise of the argument. Also, any material thing will exist contingently, will be imperfect and will be finite. Whereas these abstract truths are necessary, which mean that they cannot fail to exist, they can be derived from perfect and idealized geometric objects and there are an infinite amount of mathematical propositions, let alone the series of numbers being infinite. So, such necessary abstract truths do not depend on any material thing.

Yes they do. 1+1=2 is not a contingent truth, but a necessary one. That the sum of the internal angles of a triangle adds up to 180 degrees is another necessary truth, not a contingent one. I already explained why these truths are not derived or dependent upon material reality (i.e. the universe). Even if the universe was radically different, these mathematical propositions would still be true because the universe is constantly changing while these truths are unchangeable.

 This view, as far as I'm aware, is called conceptualism and it posits that these necessary abstract truths are constructed and invented by the human mind. 

And I already went over the problems with this position. Such mathematical propositions like 1+1=2 or that the sum of the internal angles of a triangle adds up to 180 degrees or the pythagorean theorem were true before any human had known about them and they would still be true if every human being went out of existence tomorrow. 

And these mathematical propositions were true before any human being had discovered them. And they would still be true even if no human being had ever discovered them, for example, if no human had ever discovered the pythagorean theorem or the area of a circle, these propositions would still be true.

Thus, these necessary abstract truths do not depend on human minds or intellect. So, conceptualism is false.

But these abstract necessary truths are not dependent on the universe either. Even if the entire universe went out of existence tomorrow, it would still be true that 1+1=2 or that the area of a circle would equal πr^2. So, if they are not dependent on human minds or material reality, then how do they exist? Well, since they are abstract, they must be grounded in some sort of intellect or mind. And since these abstract truths are necessary, they must be grounded in a necessarily existing intellect.

"If there was no existence, nothing would exist. No numbers, no propositions, no truths, no intellects."

Okay....and so what? How does this address anything I said. In fact, I agree with you. Absent necessary and self-subsisting existence (which is what is classically understood as God), nothing would exist, which is impossible because nothing cannot have existence, by definition. But, I'm pretty sure this is not what you had in mind. 

 "How do you know that the state of affairs could not have been absolute, philosophical nothingness?"

Because nothing is not a "state of affairs". To be a "state of affairs" is to be something, so since nothing is not something, the "state of affairs" of absolute nothingness is an oxymoron. Also, there cannot be absolute nothingness because there is a necessary being which cannot not exist.

"You're just asserting a necessary being exists, I can assert it doesn't in the same way with the same persuasive force."

No. I gave an argument (not just an assertion) for why a necessary intellect must exist and you have not addressed any of its premises. 

Necessary abstract truths exist (like the mathematical propositions I presented before). Such truths are abstract in that they are objects of thought grounded in an mind or intellect. Thus, we must come to the necessarily existing intellect that serves as the ontological basis for the existence of the necessary abstract truths. Q.E.D

I never said anything about logic or numbers. I said that mathematical propositions (such as 1+1=2 or the pythagorean theorem) were true before any human being existed and they would still be true even if no human beings had thought about or knew about them and even if the entire human race went out of existence, these mathematical propositions would still be true. Therefore, these truths are not dependent on the human beings and cannot be reduced to being the mere constructs of human minds.

" The fact that 'a unicorn is a unicorn and not not a unicorn' is true timelessly just speaks to the nature of our definitions"

If this is true timelessly, as you say, then this truth does not depend on our minds because if it did, then it would be contingent on our minds and thus, it would live and die with us. But then it wouldn't be true timelessly.

Again, such mathematical propositions are true independent of the existence or activity of human minds. Even if every human in the whole world thought that 1+1=5, it would still be true that 1+1=2. Even if everyone in the whole world thought that the Pythagorean theorem was wrong, it would still be true. Even if no one in human history had ever discovered or known that the area of a circle equals πr^2, it would still be true that the area of a circle is πr^2. All of this indicates that these truths are not the mere constructs of human minds as they are true independent of the existence and activity of human minds. 

I literally just gave you a sound deductive argument for why a necessary intellect must exist. There is no better evidence than that as it provides a necessarily true conclusion.

No, possible world are worlds where things could have existed but do not exist in the actual world. And logical contradictions like "a married bachelor" or "a four-sided triangle" or that "1+1=3" are logical contradictions that do not exist in any possible world. And mathematical propositions are true in every possible world because denying them results in contradiction.

Something exists if it has actuality or being. Since, we do actually have thoughts of such abstract objects, they can be said to exist since they have actuality or being as abstractions grounded in intellect.

"why prefix “abstract truths” 

They are abstract because they are not grounded in concrete reality. For example, the angles of a triangle will add up to 180 degrees even if there was no material or concrete triangle. And even if you erased all pictures or drawings of triangles, it would still exist as abstractions in a mind. They are truths because they are true. It is true that 1+1=2, so it is a truth.

"“necessary”? How are they necessary?"

They are necessary truths because they cannot fail to be true. 1+1=2 is true in every possible world. There is no possible world where 1+1 equals 3, or 10, or 500 or 298342, just 2. It's the same with truths like the Pythagorean theorem or the area of a circle.  They cannot be any other way. So, if it is true in every possible world, then they are necessary truths in that they cannot fail to be true.

Here is the syllogism:

Necessary abstract truths exist (like the mathematical propositions I presented before). Such truths are abstract in that they are objects of thought grounded in an mind or intellect. Thus, we must come to the necessarily existing intellect that serves as the ontological basis for the existence of the necessary abstract truths. Q.E.D

The eternality of these truths flow from there necessity as if they could fail to be true at one time and not at another, then they could possible fail to be true. But, if it could fail to be true, then it would be contingent and not necessary. Therefore, since these truths are necessary, they must be eternally true, hence, why they are eternal truths. 

The necessary intellect must exist in a purely actual way because if it has some potential for existence, then it could possibly fail to exist. But, since it is impossible for something necessary to fail to exist, the necessarily existing intellect must be purely actual. And from its pure actuality, we can derive the other divine attributes.

 "They don’t “exist” simply because one defines existence in such a way as to include them." 

That is not my definition of existence.  That's literally what it means. To have being or actuality is what it means to exist. YOU cannot define existence in such a narrow and restricted sense so as to rule out the existence of abstract objects (like if you said that existence is that which occupies space, time or is material). Because after all, abstractions actually do exist (i.e. have being or actuality) as thoughts grounded in an intellect or mind.

"We have experience only with this world so one still has to make a case for the validity of such a statement."

Again, I think you have misunderstood the nature of these truths. They are not derived from the universe or some sort of experiment or "experience" or observation or "the laws of the universe" (whatever that means). They are unchangeable and objective facts that would be true no matter what happens in the universe and even if the universe went out of existence tomorrow, they would still be true. This means that they are not grounded in material reality and are true independent of the existence and activity of the universe. 

Furthermore, no material thing has the perfection that geometric objects have; there are no perfect lines, angles, circles or spheres in material reality. So, the abstract truths that are derived from these geometric abstract objects do not depend on material reality since they are not found or observed in the universe. Also, the series of numbers and the amount of mathematical propositions is infinite, while there are only finitely many material things. yet another reason why such necessary truths cannot depend on material reality.

 It is difficult to define 'being' because there is nothing more fundamental to it. Outside of being, there is non-being or nothing. But, being cannot be defined in terms of "nothing". So, that's why it is difficult to define.  You could say that something is actual if it is real, or really is the case. And since it really is the case the we have thoughts of abstract objects, they must be real and thus, actual, and thus they must exist as thoughts grounded in intellect.
