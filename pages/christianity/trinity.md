# Trinity

- Note: it is forbidden to worship creatures (need citation), but clearly the Theophanies are worshipped

- Angel of the Lord interacts with Hagar and is itentified as God: "Then the Angel of the Lord said to her, 'I will multiply your descendants exceedingly, so that they shall not be counted for multitude.'" (Genesis 16:10 NKJV)... "Then she called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees [Heb. El Roi]; for she said, 'Have I also here seen [the back of] Him who sees me?' 14 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi[Well of the One Who Lives and Sees Me]." (Genesis 16:13-14 NKJV).

- Note this: Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground. Exodus 3:5

- "And God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM." And He said, "Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, 'I AM has sent me to you.'"" (Exodus 3:14 NKJV).

"Behold, I send an Angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. 21 Beware of Him and obey His voice; do not provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgressions; for My name (Yahweh) is in Him." - Exodus 23:20-21

Abraham eats with God (a manifestation of the Logos/Jesus, the Angel in history): "Then the Lord appeared to him (Abraham) by the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, and said, “My Lord, if I have now found favor in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant." - Genesis 18:1-3

18 And he said, “Please, show me Your glory.” 19 Then He said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you - Exodus 33:18-19.  God shows Moses a DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTE, not His glory, but His goodness!

"You cannot see My face; for no man shall see Me, and live." -Exodus 33:20

check out what St. Paul says in 2 Corinthians 3 (written 55-56 AD) Glory of the New Covenant in relation to Exodus 33:18-20.  The glory that Moses saw is the same that we see in Christ

Other notes:

- We don't know what it was like in Eden because the only world we've experienced is the fallen world.  The status of things in Eden were not the same as they are now after the fall because of what was revealed in scripture. [1]

- Theophany: a visible manifestation to humankind of God (make a "terms" page)
- Father: the uncreated Godhead
- Son: the Logos and only-begotten of the Father
- Spirit:

- Arianism: The heresy denying the divinity of Christ.

- If God is an absolutely simple(all attributes are one, no parts, etc), invisible, spiritual Essence then its a problem to understand how there can be an Incarnation in time and space that doesn't incarnate the whole essence of God.  HOW COULD GOD WALK IN THE GARDEN IF HE DIDNT INCARNATE?  Note also that God had a body before taking on human nature. [1] (throw this in ADS vs EE section)

There is only 1 uncreated God (3 divine persons)

- Note: "Angel" just means "messengar", it can be human, spiritual, or divine
